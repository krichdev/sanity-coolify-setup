# Self Host Sanity Studio with Coolify

From your Coolify dashboard, select or add a new project.

Within the project, add a new github project (public or private), and link this your sanity repo.

Under resource configuration, these updates:
- Build Pack: Nixpacks
- Optionally: Update domain
- Publish Directory: /dist (assuming sanity defaults were not updated)
- Enable the `Is it a static site?` option

Now your Sanity studio application will be ready to deploy.
